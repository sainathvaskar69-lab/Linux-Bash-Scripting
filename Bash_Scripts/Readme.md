# Bash Scripting for Cybersecurity Practice

##  Overview
This repository contains **Bash scripting exercises focused on cybersecurity use-cases**.

The scripts are written to build **practical Linux automation skills** required in real security roles, not academic scripting.

Bash is widely used in:
- SOC environments
- Incident response
- Threat hunting
- System hardening
- Red team tooling
- Blue team automation

This repository exists to train that mindset.

##  Security-Relevant Concepts Practiced
- Linux file and directory analysis
- Log and file monitoring
- Disk and system resource checks
- Automation of repetitive security tasks
- Conditional logic for alerting and validation
- Safe handling of system paths and permissions

---

## 🗂 Repository Structure
Each script focuses on **one security-oriented concept**.

Examples include:
- File system monitoring
- Archiving large or suspicious files
- RAM and disk usage checks
- Bash control structures used in security automation

Scripts are intentionally small to reflect **real SOC and IR utility scripts**, not academic examples.

## Matters in Cybersecurity
In real environments:
- Analysts automate checks instead of clicking GUIs
- Incident responders use Bash to triage systems quickly
- Attackers also use Bash — defenders must understand it

---

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
- For learning and lab practice only
- Not production hardened
- No malicious functionality included
