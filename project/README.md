# Bash Automation Projects for Cybersecurity

## Overview
This repository contains small Bash scripting projects created to build practical Linux automation skills required in entry-level cybersecurity roles, especially SOC Analyst (L1).

The focus is not on advanced programming, but on:
- System visibility
- Operational awareness
- Automation of repetitive security-related tasks

These scripts reflect real activities performed in Linux-based security environments.

## Projects Included

### 1. Archive Project
**Purpose:**  
Automates archiving of files and directories.

**Cybersecurity Relevance:**
- Log rotation and backup
- Evidence preservation during incident response
- Data management on Linux servers

---

### 2. Calculator
**Purpose:**  
Simple command-line calculator using Bash functions and arguments.

**Cybersecurity Relevance:**
- Understanding input handling
- Function usage in scripts
- Logic building for automation tasks

(This project is focused on Bash fundamentals rather than security operations.)

---

### 3. Connectivity Check
**Purpose:**  
Checks network connectivity to a remote host using `ping`.

**Cybersecurity Relevance:**
- Network availability validation
- First-level troubleshooting during alerts
- Detecting connectivity loss or isolation

Common SOC use-case: verifying whether a system can reach critical services.

---

### 4. File System Status (FS_status)
**Purpose:**  
Monitors disk usage and filesystem health.

**Cybersecurity Relevance:**
- Detecting disk exhaustion attacks
- Preventing service disruption
- Monitoring system resource abuse

Disk issues often trigger security and availability alerts in SOC environments.

---

### 5. RAM Monitoring
**Purpose:**  
Checks current memory usage on the system.

**Cybersecurity Relevance:**
- Detecting abnormal memory consumption
- Identifying potential malware or runaway processes
- Supporting system health monitoring

High RAM usage is a common indicator during incident investigation.
